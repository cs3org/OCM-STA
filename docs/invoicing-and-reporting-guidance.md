## Reporting Guidance

When submitting an invoice to Sovereign Tech Agency, we need to verify that the work you are invoicing for has been completed. The report that you submit with your invoice helps us to verify the work delivered. Since we support many types of activities that may require different reporting structures, and to allow our contractors the flexibility of using their existing reporting mechanisms, we don't have a strict report format. The only requirement is that the documentation can help us verify that the work has been completed as contractually agreed upon.

> DO YOU SEE A POTENTIAL DEVIATION FROM THE WORK PLAN AS WRITTEN IN YOUR CONTRACT DUE TO SOME NEW CIRCUMSTANCES? OR YOU WANT TO CHANGE A WORK DETAIL BECAUSE YOU LEARNED SOME NEW INFORMATION? NO WORRIES, THAT IS USUALLY POSSIBLE, YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE YOUR PROGRAM MANAGER AWARE OF IT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE TO AMEND THE AGREED UPON WORK PLAN.

While there is no required format, here are a few guidelines that can help you:

- Reports can be submitted in a variety of formats to accommodate your existing reporting mechanisms. For ease of access however, we recommend submitting your reports in PDF or markdown (plain text) when possible.

- The language in the report should match the description of the work in the contract. Doing so makes it easy for your program manager to determine which work item in the contract corresponds to your report. Additionally, the language in your invoice should match both.

- If the work is documented as changes to a code repository in publicly accessible commit, merge, pull request, or another source code management action, you can simply provide the links to the corresponding action. Some contractors prefer to tag or categorize these changes when possible for ease of collating them when reporting.

- Additionally, if the output of the work is any tangible deliverable (for example a document or code), you can provide a link to the work if it's publicly available, or attach it to your report.

- If the work has no tangible deliverable that can be pointed to, you can write a paragraph describing the following:

  - What the goal of the work item was (as described in the contract)  
  - Describe how you achieved those goals or did that work  
  - Describe any results from performing that work item.

- The goal of reporting is to help your program manager verify that the work has been done, so please provide the right level of detail to assist them with that.

- Providing tangible deliverables (when applicable) that are properly annotated and can be easily tied to the contractual terms is ideal.

- Reports that are minimal in information may require follow up questions from your program manager and delay the processing of your invoice.

- Conversely, reports that are too verbose and hard to read will also require more time from your program manager to process, and may still require follow up questions for clarification.
